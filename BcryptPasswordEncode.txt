Bcrypt is a cryptographic hash function designed for password hashing and safe storing in the backend of applications
 in a way that is less susceptible to dictionary-based cyberattacks.
 It was created in 1999 by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, using the Blowfish cipher algorithm as its base

The technology in the Bcrypt algorithm and process limits attacks and makes it harder for attackers to compromise passwords.
 Bcrypt was not designed for encrypting large amounts of data. It is best implemented for passwords,
 however SHA-256 is better for large amounts of data because it is less costly and faster
 
* with SHA-256 algorithm or other algorithms, with a same string, algorithm will hash it into same degist
	* example: encode first: 123 -> abcd
			   encode secong: 123 -> abcd

* with bcrypt: using blowfish algorithm, combine with salt, streching. with same string will be encoded into different degist.			   
	* example: encode first: 123 -> abcd
			   encode second: 123 -> dfgh
	* but when compare between this two degist -> authought it is different but it matchs each other
	* using for password in applications.
